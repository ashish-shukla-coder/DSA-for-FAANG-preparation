# You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of exactly two nodes of the
# tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its structure.

# Examples:
# Input: root = [1,3, null, null,2]
# Output: [3,1, null, null,2]
# Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3
# makes the BST valid.
